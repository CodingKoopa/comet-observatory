# Replacing Logisim

These are some notes on Digital Circuit Software that i

### Logisim (Java)
- http://www.cburch.com/logisim/
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/

Logisim has not received any official updates since it's [2.7.1 release](https://sourceforge.net/p/circuit/mailman/message/27237820/), in 2011. The developer went on to commence work on [Toves](https://sourceforge.net/p/circuit/news/2013/06/work-commences-on-toves-successor-to-logisim/), intending on it to replace Logisim.

In 2014, [Logisim development was suspended indefinitely](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/retire-note.html)

### Toves (C#)
- http://www.toves.org/
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/toves/

Toves is the successor to Logisim, but is far from achieving feature parity from it. It hasn't received an update since its 0.0.2 release in 2013. Burch did not mention this software at all in Logisim's retire note, so it's safe to assume that this will not fill the hole left by Logisim.

### So then what?
Logisim is officially unmaintained. Toves isn't going to replace it. So then what?

### logisim-evolution (Java)
- https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution

This is basically the de-facto maintanence fork of Logisim.

### Digital (Java)
- https://github.com/hneemann/Digital

The ArchWiki mentions this as an alternative to Logisim. I would consider this to be the leading successor to Logisim - what Toves should have been.
