  "Understanding 100% of everything is impossible. That’s why we spend all our lives trying to \
understand the thinking of others. That’s what makes life so interesting."
  "Sometimes you need a little wishful thinking just to keep on living."
  "Part of growing up means finding a way to interact with others while distancing pain."
  "Never underestimate the ability of the human animal to adapt to its environment."
  "Any new position from which you view your reality will change your perception of its nature. \
It's all literally a matter of perspective."
  "Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it. That's how fragile the truth for a \
human is."
  "Anywhere can be paradise, as long as you have the will to live. After all, you are alive, so you \
will always have the chance to be happy. As long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth exist, \
everything will be alright."
  "Humans constantly feel pain in their hearts. Because the heart is so sensitive to pain, humans \
also feel that to live is to suffer."
  "I'm so fucked up."
  "Kimochi warui."
  # Mob Psycho 100
  "The biggest distinguishing feature of humans is how rich and varied their emotions are. These \
emotions are the reason they thrive and also the reason they fight."
  "You should realize that you're only able to survive thanks to the help of others."
  # The Great Gatsby
  "It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have ex-pended \
your own powers of adjustment."
  "Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in \
whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams."
  "For a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this \
continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to \
face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."
  "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
