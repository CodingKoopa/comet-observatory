# Though I really try to use Xorg configuration files wherever possible, I just could not make it
# work here. I faithfully made an equivalent configuration, and also had systemd-localed confirm
# that I am doing it right, but it simply would not take effect. [1]
#
# I also tried pre-compiling the XKB keymap by using `setxkbmap â€¦ -print > xorg.xkb`, and loading
# it here using `xkbcomp xorg.xkb "$DISPLAY"`. But, no matter *how* late in this file I do it, that
# also does not work. If I run it from Konsole after starting dwm, though, then it works just fine.
# In either case, it produces some errors that don't seem to be relevant.
#
# So, we have this: running setxkbmap every time. On the bright side, this is a different beast than
# running `xrandr` at launch: there is no mode setting or anything. Just compiling the keymap and
# applying it to the X server.
